Project Title: Customer Segmentation in E-Commerce Using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
Introduction: This project implements a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to classify and visualize e-commerce customers into different segments based on their purchasing behavior, demographic details, and browsing patterns. SOMs help in unsupervised learning of high-dimensional data and map it to a 2D grid for better visualization.
It contains details like:
Customer ID
Age, Gender, Location
Transaction Frequency
Total Spending, Product Categories, et
Software Requirements:
Python 3.8+
Libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib (for visualization)
scikit-learn (for preprocessing)
miniSom (SOM implementation)
Hardware Requirements:
A machine with at least 4GB RAM for small datasets.
For larger datasets, it is recommended to have 8GB RAM or more.
